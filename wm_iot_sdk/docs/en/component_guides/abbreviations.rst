    AT log port
      The port that is used to output log. More details are in the :term:`AT port` introduction.

    AT port
      AT port is the general name of AT log port (that is used to output log) and AT command port (that is used to send AT commands and receive responses). Please refer to for default AT port pins and for how to customize them.

    Command Mode
      Default operating mode of AT. In the command mode, any character received by the AT command port will be treated as an AT command, and AT returns the command execution result to the AT command port.
      AT enters :term:`Data Mode` from :term:`Command Mode` in the following cases.

      .. parsed-literal::

        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSEND <cmd-SEND>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSEND <cmd-SEND>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSENDL <cmd-SENDL>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSENDEX <cmd-SENDEX>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        |Equipment-Name| * After sending the :ref:`AT+BTSPPSEND <cmd-BTSPPSEND>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.
        |Equipment-Name| * After sending the :ref:`AT+BLESPP <cmd-BLESPP>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.

      In the data mode, send the :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>` command, AT will exit from :term:`Data Mode` and enter the :term:`Command Mode`.

    Data Mode
      In the data mode, any character received by the AT command port will be treated as data (except for special :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>`) instead of the AT command, and these data will be sent to the opposite end without modification.
      AT enters :term:`Data Mode` from :term:`Command Mode` in the following cases.

      .. parsed-literal::

        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSEND <cmd-SEND>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSEND <cmd-SEND>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSENDL <cmd-SENDL>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        * After sending the :ref:`AT+CIPSENDEX <cmd-SENDEX>` set command successfully and returns `OK`.
        |Equipment-Name| * After sending the :ref:`AT+BTSPPSEND <cmd-BTSPPSEND>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.
        |Equipment-Name| * After sending the :ref:`AT+BLESPP <cmd-BLESPP>` execute command successfully and returns `OK`.

      In the data mode, send the :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>` command, AT will exit from :term:`Data Mode` and enter the :term:`Command Mode`.

    manufacturing nvs
      Manufacturing Non-Volatile Storage. ``manufacturing nvs`` stores all certificates, private keys, GATTS data, module information, Wi-Fi configurations, UART configurations, etc. These configurations are finally built into the ``mfg_nvs.bin`` file and downloaded to the flash at the address defined in ``at_customize.csv``.

    MSB
      Most Significant Bit

    MTU
      maximum transmission unit
      
    NVS

    Normal Transmission Mode
      Default Transmission Mode

      In normal transmission mode, users can send AT commands. For examples, users can send MCU data received by AT command port to the opposite end of transmission by :ref:`AT+CIPSEND <cmd-SEND>`; and the data received from the opposite end of transmission will also be returned to MCU through AT command port with additional prompt: `+IPD`.

      During a normal transmission, if the connection breaks, |Equipment-Name| will give a prompt and will not attempt to reconnect.

      More details are in :term:`Transmission Mode Shift Diagram`.

    OWE
      Opportunistic Wireless Encryption. OWE is a Wi-Fi standard which ensures that the communication between each pair of endpoints is protected from other endpoints.

      More details are in `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_Wireless_Encryption>`__.

    Passthrough Mode
      
	  Also called as "Passthrough Sending & Receiving Mode".
      
      In passthrough mode, users cannot send AT commands except special :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>` command. All MCU data received by AT command port will be sent to the opposite end of transmission without any modification; and the data received from the opposite end of transmission will also be returned to MCU through AT command port without any modification.

      During the Wi-Fi passthrough transmission, if the connection breaks, |Equipment-Name| (as client) will keep trying to reconnect until :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>` is input to exit the passthrough transmission; |Equipment-Name| (as server) will shutdown the old connection and listen new connection until :ref:`+++ <cmd-PLUS>` is input to exit the passthrough transmission.

      More details are in :term:`Transmission Mode Shift Diagram`.

    Passthrough Receiving Mode
      The temporary mode between :term:`Normal Transmission Mode` and :term:`Passthrough Mode`.

      In passthrough receiving mode, AT cannot send any data to the opposite end of transmission; but the data received from the opposite end of transmission can be returned to MCU through AT command port without any modification. More details are in :term:`Transmission Mode Shift Diagram`.
