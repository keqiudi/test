            SSID (network name) for the example to connect to.

            WiFi password (WPA or WPA2) for the example to use.

            Interval for station to listen to beacon from AP. The unit of listen interval is one beacon interval.
            For example, if beacon interval is 100 ms and listen interval is 3, the interval for station to listen
            to beacon is 300 ms.

            For Station, If the station does not receive a beacon frame from the connected SoftAP during the
            inactive time, disconnect from SoftAP. Default 6s.

        help
            Modem sleep mode includes minimum and maximum power save modes.
            In minimum power save mode, station wakes up every DTIM to receive beacon. Broadcast data will not be
            lost because it is transmitted after DTIM. However, it can not save much more power if DTIM is short
            for DTIM is determined by AP.
            In maximum power save mode, station wakes up every listen interval to receive beacon. Broadcast data
            may be lost because station may be in sleep state at DTIM time. If listen interval is longer, more power
            is saved but broadcast data is more easy to lose.

        config EXAMPLE_POWER_SAVE_NONE
